# OBP Hitting Documentation

## C3D

Cleaned C3D files are provided at `~\baseball_hitting\data\c3d` for those who wish to conduct their own analysis process from start to finish. C3Ds are separated into athlete-specific folders with static model files also provided.

### File Naming

All C3Ds follow a common naming convention.

`USERid_SESSIONid_HEIGHT_WEIGHT_SIDE_SWINGNUMBER_EXITVELOCITY.c3d`

`USERid` = unique athlete identifier

`SESSIONid` = unique session identifier

`HEIGHT` = body height in inches (body height in meters is also provided in the metadata CSV)

`WEIGHT` = bodyweight in pounds (body mass in kilograms is also provided in the metadata CSV)

`SIDE` = hitting side (L = left handed swing, R = right handed swing)

`SWINGNUMBER` = swing number from the athlete’s assessment

`EXITVELOCITY` = speed of the ball after contact in miles per hour to one decimal place (with the decimal place removed)

- ex. `~_905.c3d` would be an exit velocity of 90.5 mph; `~_950.c3d` would be an exit velocity of 95.0 mph

## Marker Set

### Front View

![image2.png](imgs/image2.png)

_NOTE: LIC and RIC (Iliac Crest markers) are no longer used and may not be present in some C3D files. Additionally, RKNEE2 and LKNEE2 are labeled as RMKNE and LMKNE respectively._

### Back View

![image3.png](imgs/image3.png)

_NOTE: LIC and RIC (Iliac Crest markers) are no longer used and may not be present in some C3D files. Additionally, RKNEE2 and LKNEE2 are labeled as RMKNE and LMKNE respectively._

### Bat Rigid Body

Ten markers are used to track the bat. MARKER1, MARKER2, and MARKER3 are consistent across all bats and are used to define the proximal and distal ends of the rigid body. Markers 4-10 are used for tracking and the location of these markers vary from bat to bat.

## Force Plates

Ground reaction force data were collected using four force plates embedded underneath the batter’s box turf surface (average turf thickness ~ 0.5 inches).

![hitting_force_plates.PNG](imgs/hitting_force_plates.png)

**_NOTE: Hitters will start with one or both feet on the back force plate (#4 or #3) and land with just their lead leg on the front force plate (#1 or #2)._**

## Global Coordinate System

The global (laboratory) reference frame is such that (+) x points from home plate toward the pitcher’s mound, (+) y points toward the right-handed batter’s box, and (+) z points upward

# Pitching Machine Setup

All swings were collected while hitting off of a pitching machine set at ~65 mph from ~40 ft away from home plate.

# Full Signal

We first calculate joint angles and velocities as well as bat angles and velocities according to the right hand rule. We then perform select adjustments to better match coach/player intuition (righty/lefty symmetry, sign negations, adding or subtracting 90 degrees, etc.).

Below is a list of joint and bat mechanics, their components, and conventions. Where joint kinematics are constrained by the model, corresponding kinetic conventions are provided.

### Processed Ground Reaction Force Conventions

Ground reaction force data were filtered with a 4th order Butterworth low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 40.0 Hz

| Force Plate | X                  | Y             | Z            |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| All         | + = Toward Pitcher | + = Posterior | + = Superior |

### Table Schema

Full signal data are broken up into four large CSV files:

- `force_plate`: rear leg, lead leg ground reaction forces
- `joint angles`: joint angles
- `joint_velos`: joint angular velocities
- `landmarks`: joint center positions

Tables may be joined using `session_swing` + `time`. Please note that force plate and marker-derived data are provided at their own respective measurement rates (360 Hz and 1,080 Hz,
respectively). Therefore, we recommend caution when joining force plate and marker-derived data to avoid potential data loss.

The times at which common events occurred are also joined in each table for convenience. Provided events are front foot contact (10% bodyweight), front foot plant (100% bodyweight), and contact.

One potential research project is to process the provided C3D using your own pipeline and compare your results with ours. Self-processed data from C3D files may be linked to the provided full signal data through the metadata CSV located at `~\baseball_hitting\data\metadata.csv`.

In addition to biomechanical POI metrics, we also provide pitch level HitTrax data in `~\data\poi\hittrax.csv`. Those familiar with exporting raw HitTrax data should recognize most of the columns.

```python
'session_swing': unique swing identifier
'pitch': velocity of incoming pitch (from machine) (mph)
'strike_zone': strike zone region of pitch
'la': launch angle (deg)
'dist': carry distance (ft)
'res': predicted result of ball in play
'bearing': spray angle (deg) (0 = straight back at pitcher; + = lefty pull field, - = righty pull field)
'vertical_distance': distance from center of strike zone (inches) (+ values = higher than middle of strike zone)
'horizontal_distance': distance from center of strike zone (inches) (+ values = pitches inside to right handed batter)
'poi_x': horizontal point of impact coordinate (0 = back tip of home plate; + = inside to left handed batter)
'poi_y': vertical point of impact coordinate (0 = ground; + = above ground)
'poi_z': point of impact coordinate (0 = back tip of home plate; + values = towards pitcher)
'pitch_angle': decent angle of incoming pitch (deg)
```

HitTrax strike zone zones are as follows:
